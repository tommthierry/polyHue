# PolyHue â€” quick primer for the AI

* Converts a 2-D image into a multi-colour 3-D model (lithophane or flat).
* 100 % front-end (Vite + TypeScript + Three.js). No server code.
* Key domains:
  * **Mode** = `"lithophane"` | `"color"`
  * **Region** = contiguous pixel cluster after quantisation
  * **Filament** = vendor/name + HEX + transmission-distance (TD)

When generating code or explanations:

1. Default to **TypeScript ES modules**.
2. Use **Web Workers** for CPU-heavy tasks (quantisation, mesh export).
3. Respect the data models in `types.ts`.


# ðŸ“‘ PROJECT.md is the source of truth

* `PROJECT.md` (at repo root) contains the complete requirements and goals for PolyHue.
* Whenever the AI generates or reviews code, it **must** reference `PROJECT.md`
  to confirm:
  1. The feature or change is listed or consistent with the spec.
  2. Names, data models, and workflows match the doc.
* If something is unclear, the AI should reopen `PROJECT.md`, search for relevant
  sections, and reconcile before proceeding.
